# # Day6 File Handling & Error Handling

# # File Handling in Python
# # File handling is an important part of programming. It allows us to read from and write to files on our system.
# # In Python, we can handle files using built-in functions and methods.


# # "w" = write mode (overwrites the file if it exists)
# with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
#     f.write("Hello Asad!\n")
#     f.write("ayuwefcw cwejhvfuw uf weufwu vfwvef wef wuc wghec ghwefvghwefwefghwe fwe f weghf vwe we.\n")
# print("‚úÖ File written successfully!")

# #inserting data into a file 
# with open("asad.text","w") as f:
#     f.write("Hello Asad Waqas")
#     f.write("ayuwefcw cwejhvfuw uf weufwu vfwvef wef wuc wghec ghwefvghwefwefghwe fwe f weghf vwe we")
# print("File written successfully!")
# #reading data of a file 
# with open("asad.text", "r") as f:
#     content=f.read()
# print(content)

# #appending to a file
# # "a" = append mode (adds new data without removing old data)
# with open("example.txt", "a") as f:
#     f.write("This line is newly added!\n")
# print("‚úÖ Text appended to file!")

# #reading a file line by line
# with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
#     for line in f:
#         print(line.strip())
        
# # Error Handling in Python
# # Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in a program.
# # In Python, we can handle errors using try and except blocks.

# try:
#     with open("asad.text", "r") as f:
#         content = f.read()
#     print(content)
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print("‚ùå File not found! Please check filename.")
